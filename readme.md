# Legion TD 2 Super Scout

This is a CLI program for analyzing opponents while loading into the game - looking at their profiles yourself is way too much effort - you're a gamerâ„¢ after all.

## Setup

You'll need to generate an API key [here](https://developer.legiontd2.com/) and save it in a file called `.env` with the contents:

```env
API_KEY="Replace me with your API Key"
```

This file needs to be located in the Super Scout folder.

## Running the program

You'll need to have Node installed on your computer, then navigate on the Command Line to the Super Scout folder and run one of the following alias commands:

`npm start`
`npm run`
`npm scout`
`node .\index.js`
